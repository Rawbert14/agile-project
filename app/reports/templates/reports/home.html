Upon selecting the project you are currently engaged in, you gain the ability to log task projects associated with active sprints. This includes recording the actual time expended versus the estimated duration. Additionally, you have the option to report any encountered problems, which will be prominently featured on the question board for swift attention by your supervisor.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, our platform allows you the flexibility to rectify errors by editing the logged task or even deleting it, provided it was originally created by you. This feature ensures that you have control over the accuracy and completeness of your task records, enhancing overall project management efficiency.</p>
