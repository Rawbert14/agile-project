<p> Displayed below is a comprehensive directory of all project members, featuring their usernames and email addresses for easy communication. Additionally, each member's profile includes a brief bio and their specialization within the team, enabling you to contact the individual most suited to address your specific questions or needs.</p>
<p> A particularly valuable aspect is the inclusion of the 'joined date' field. This information provides insight into a member's tenure within the team. Those who recently joined may still be acclimating to the project, while those with longer tenures are likely to possess a deeper understanding of ongoing projects.</p>
<p> Feel free to utilize this resource to connect with team members, leveraging their expertise and insights. If you have any further inquiries or require assistance in navigating the directory, please don't hesitate to reach out at 2549168a@student.gla.ac.uk We aim to facilitate effective communication and collaboration within the team. </p>
